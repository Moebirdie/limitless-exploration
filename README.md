# limitless-exploration

## Project Description
This project is the start of a portfolio for prospective employers.  Each project card will link to a GitHub hosted project where my skills as a full stack developer can be evaluated.  This first phase is a fun version built in HTML and CSS only.  Only the labeled projects link to placeholder projects that I hope to complete this year.  This README will also be updated as we progress through the program.

The site can be found at this url: https://moebirdie.github.io/limitless-exploration/  and is fully mobile responsive.
